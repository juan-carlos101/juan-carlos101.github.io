<p> My name is Juan Carlos and I have been a student at CSM for a little more than 2 years now. Since I was young I always had an intest in computers.
I have been playing videogames since I was 3 years old and playing soccer since I was 4. Other intrests of mine include running, hiking, exercising, going to 
different places and taking pictures.

<p>I am attending this class because I want to improve my knowledge using html, CSS, and JavaScript. My focus would be to be better on app based projects as that has been 
an area of weakness. I have taken web development courses before one of them being an intro class so I do have prior knowledge. Another reason for me attending this class is 
to complete part of my major requirement for my associates degree here at CSM.
